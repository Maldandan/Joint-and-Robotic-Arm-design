# Joint Design
## Original design

the original design was made to connect the upper and lower legs of the robot design, however, some fixing and redesigning were necessary.

in the old design, the lower leg was connected to the rod with a bearing installed, which is good for reducing the friction and allowing smoother movement.

for the upper leg, on the other hand, in was installed to the rod directly on the uniform diameter rod, which will result in huge error in expected results from calculations, since the part isn't fixed to the rod nor its rotating freely.

## Redesigned joint
redesigning the joint, I have modified the rod and remodeled the upper and lower support to prevent failure in the parts!

# Lower part
for the lower part, installing the bearing before connecting it to the rest of the body is obviously still necessary. I have increased the diameter of the support to insure it can sustain higher reaction forces, reducing its length would also be ideal to minimize moment force acting on it!
it would be beneficial to also make a fillet on the edges to take care of the stress concentrations areas!

### Upper Part
similar to the lower part, nothing much to discus here, except that I didn't use bearings here since it's to be fixed to the rod to prevent it from rotation. This is very important for the accuracy of our calculations and for precise movement of the robot.

The hole was made as a keyway to install keys to fix it to the rod preventing rotation.

### Rod
The rod was redesigned in such a way to prevent the upper part from moving left to right and to prevent the lower part from rotating!

in the mid point, i have reduced the diameter of the rod with a length equals to that of the bearing,
keyways was also introduces to its both ends similarly to the lower part to fix them together
